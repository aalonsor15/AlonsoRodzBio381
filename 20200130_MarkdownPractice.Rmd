In this chunk of code I can set up global options for all of the chunks of code in this file.
Choosing echo = False will make my code not show up in the final document. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Here are some examples of equations using LaTeX:

$a + b$
$$a + b$$
$$\alpha + \beta$$
$$S_a$$

$$S_{a + b}$$
$$S_{a + b_{\alpha + \beta}}$$
$$Z^{a+b}$$
$$P(\mbox{occurrence of species A})= Z_A$$ #the mbox function allows plain text to be included into equations in LaTeX.


### Now we will work on FENCING:

```
plain text and nothing else.
$$\alpha + \beta$$
```

Use a single backtick for plain text `in a sentence`.

The value of $\pi$ is `r pi`.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# We want to get in the habit of commenting all of our code, because that is the only way to make our work repeatable. Make comments!
runif(10)

# Using eval=FALSE will remove the output from the html file. Using echo=FALSE will remove the chunk code from the html file.
```







This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
